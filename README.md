# 🐚 **ShellKill** 💀🔥

## Overview 📖
**ShellKill** is a Python tool designed to upload a **web shell** to a target server and trigger it using various **evasion techniques** to bypass file upload restrictions. A **web shell** is a script that provides remote access and control over a web server. By uploading a web shell, an attacker can execute commands on the target server, manipulate files, and potentially escalate privileges.

The tool also supports **automatic retries**, file upload validation, and vulnerability scanning for common web vulnerabilities such as **File Upload issues, LFI/RFI, XSS**, and SQL Injection.

> **Warning:** This tool can potentially cause significant damage if misused. Only use it in controlled environments where explicit permission has been granted. 🚨
