## **Pull Request Guidelines** 📋

- **Make small, focused changes**: Ensure that your PR only addresses one feature or bug fix. This makes it easier for maintainers to review and merge your contribution.
- **Write clear commit messages**: Your commit messages should describe the changes made, the problem being solved, or the feature being added.
- **Keep PR descriptions detailed**: When submitting a PR, provide detailed information about what was changed and why. If you're fixing a bug or addressing an issue, reference the issue number (e.g., `Fixes #5`).
- **Follow the coding style**: Use the existing code style and structure. If you're adding new functionality, ensure it aligns with the current design.
- **Add tests**: If you're adding new functionality or fixing a bug, add tests to ensure the changes are correct and prevent regressions.

   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected and actual behavior
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots
